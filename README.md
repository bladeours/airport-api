## General Info
This REST API is a part of Flight Search Engine project. \
I've created this project to get information about distance between two airports, I'm using it in
[random-flight-generator](https://github.com/bladeours/random-flights-generator) project. However, this API will also
show information about country or city of airport. It uses mongoDB database to get data.
